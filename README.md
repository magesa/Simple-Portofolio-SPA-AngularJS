# A Simple Portofolio SPA AngularJS App

This is an implementation of a Simple Portofolio [SPA] (Single Page Application) in AngularJS with Routing and Templating.

# The SPA App

This is a simple site with a home, projects, and contact page. Clearly, AngularJS is built for much more advanced applications than this. This [project] will show many of the concepts needed for implementing larger and more complex projects.

# The Goals

> - A Single Page Application.
> - No page refresh on page change.
> - Different data displayed on each page.
